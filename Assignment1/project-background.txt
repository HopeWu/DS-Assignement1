Inside a computer, there is a cpu, whose job is to execute tasks from different sources. In our project, there is only one cpu that can execute only one task at a time. Therefore, the tasks have to be put inside a queue before be executed.

We try to develop different implementations of the queue. Then, we compare each implementations with each other in terms of time complexity, space complexity, and its overall efficiency. The overall efficiency is the workload a cpu can do in certain amount of time. The workload is the sum of the importances of tasks performed.

We try to implement standard queue, priority queue, and half priority queue with both array and linked list respectively. Thus, we have six implementations in all.
